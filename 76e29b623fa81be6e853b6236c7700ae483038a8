      "message": "Sorry for not catching this earlier, but not all Boards have Name parameters, so doesn\u0027t this significantly change how those things are represented in the SDR?\n\nIn theory, the existing code was supposed to be equivalent, as entity-manager names the objects the same as the name parameter, the fact that Name exists on the interface is arguably a bug.\n\nIt would help a lot if you could add your motivations for wanting this to the commit message, and we\u0027ll see if we can find something that\u0027s less invasive, or figure out a way to fall back to this in certain cases.",
