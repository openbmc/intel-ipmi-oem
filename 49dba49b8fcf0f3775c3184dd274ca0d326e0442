      "message": "yep, it would definitely be simpler and allow it to us to remove the declaration of `boardData`.\n\nI moved it outside of #ifdef USING_ENTITY_MANAGER_DECORATORS internally since it is also used outside of it. but use the `name` directly seems like it is cleaner and no need to worry about the pointer.",
