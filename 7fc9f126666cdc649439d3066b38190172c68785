      "message": "Moving this update to after the map is built, not before, is a significant change. It means the map computation time will be added to the cache time. So, instead of caching the data for strictly 60 seconds (for example), you would cache the data for (60 seconds plus however long it took to build the map).\n\nThis change should be mentioned somewhere, perhaps in a comment or the commit message, because it\u0027s an important change to how long the cache time is.",
