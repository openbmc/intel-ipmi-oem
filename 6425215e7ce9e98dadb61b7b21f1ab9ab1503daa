Please check is this change solving the issue: https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/intel-ipmi-oem/+/47904\n\nThe issue is postComplete variable not getting initialized to correct value on time. So the default value, which is true is blocking the ipmi commands. Changing it to false will allow the commands in this case but need to be sure that this is the right fix.\n\nAlso, the default value of the variable is true since it is a security feature and by default we should not allow the commands.\nPlease have a look at the other change. If it is solving the issue we can abandon this change.",
