I believe the original implementation was fair enough (i.e. to disable all of SOL) and the documentation needs to be fixed instead.\n\nHowever maintainers can take a call here ðŸ˜Š",

      "message": "Unfortunately, disabling SOL backend will not disable the SOL SSH dropbear daemon listening on port 2200. User can still connect to the port, but will be kicked after connected since the backend is not running. Exploiting dropbear is still possible.\n\nIn Intel BMC, there are 3 kinds of SOL, SOL over SSH, SOL over IPMI and SOL on web. SOL over SSH should be disabled by disabling the SOL SSH daemon, SOL over IPMI can be disabled by disabling network IPMI, and disabling SOL on Web or not will not have any impact on the security side since it\u0027s BMC internal traffic.",
